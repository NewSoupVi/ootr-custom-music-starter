# Instructions

0. Have python 3 installed and added to path ("python \[filename\].py" needs to work from a command line and refer to a Python 3 installation, not Python 2. Might improve this in the future)
1. Download&unpack or clone this repo
2. Download https://github.com/TestRunnerSRL/OoT-Randomizer and place it in ootr-custom-music-starter.
3. Place a ZOOTDEC.z64 in the OoT-Randomizer folder. Generating any seed locally should create one, so you probably already have one somewhere.
4. Place the folder for any version of Bizhawk in the main directory.
5. Tell Windows to open .seq files with CustomMusicStarter.bat (Double click on any .seq file and go from there)

*You might need to install some python libraries, idk, follow the error message or annoy me on Discord or sth*

Now you should be able to double click a .seq file anywhere and it'll do all the steps automatically.

The main directory should look like this:<br/><br/>
BizHawk-2.\*/<br/>
OoT-Randomizer/<br/>
Cosmetic.json<br/>
CustomMusicStarter.bat<br/>
CustomMusicStarter.py<br/>
README.md<br/>
settings.sav<br/>
